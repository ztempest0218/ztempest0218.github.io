				<p class="align">under review at <strong><em>Economics Letters</em></strong>, submitted in June 2016</p>
				<p class="align">Abstract: Using micro-data from the Manpower Utilization Survey 1995-2015 of Taiwan, this paper exploits exogenous variation in years of schooling caused by the 9-year compulsory education reform to estimate the education return on wages. The results of fuzzy regression discontinuity design indicate that the causal effect of education on wage is approximately 4.7%, smaller than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates.</p>

				<p class="align">under review at <strong><em>Journal of Human Resources</em></strong>, submitted in July 2016</p>
				<p class="align">Abstract: Using micro-data from the Taiwan Population and Housing Census, this study estimates the causal effect of fertility on the labor supply of married women. To address the endogeneity of fertility, I exploit exogenous variations in the number of children caused by twin births, which can be considered a natural experiment. The instrumental variable estimates indicate that an additional child reduces female employment by 10.5 percentage points for those who have at least one delivery, and the effects gradually decline for females who have two or more deliveries, with the effects vanishing when females have three or more deliveries.</p>
