<p class="align">1. Estimating Returns to Education Using a Regression Discontinuity Design: Evidence from Taiwan</p>
<p class="align">under review at <strong><em>Economics Letters</em></strong>, submitted in June 2016</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="category_1" onclick="show('1');"><img alt="Graphic" title="Graphic" src="/+.gif" width="16" height="14">Abstract</a>
<div id="layer_1" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p class="align">Using micro-data from the Manpower Utilization Survey 1995-2015 of Taiwan, this paper exploits exogenous variation in years of schooling caused by the 9-year compulsory education reform to estimate the education return on wages. The results of fuzzy regression discontinuity design indicate that the causal effect of education on wage is approximately 4.7%, smaller than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates.</p></div>


<p class="align">2. A Dilemma of Fertility and Female Labor Supply: Identification Using Taiwanese Twins</p>
<p class="align">under review, submitted in July 2016</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="category_2" onclick="show('2');"><img alt="Graphic" title="Graphic" src="/+.gif" width="16" height="14">Abstract</a>
<div id="layer_2" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p class="align">Using micro-data from the Taiwan Population and Housing Census, this study estimates the causal effect of fertility on the labor supply of married women. To address the endogeneity of fertility, I exploit exogenous variations in the number of children caused by twin births, which can be considered a natural experiment. The instrumental variable estimates indicate that an additional child reduces female employment by 10.5 percentage points for those who have at least one delivery, and the effects gradually decline for females who have two or more deliveries, with the effects vanishing when females have three or more deliveries.</p></div>


<p class="align">3. The Impacts of  9-year Compulsory Education: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Taiwan</p>
<p class="align">under review, submitted in July 2016</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="category_3" onclick="show('3');"><img alt="Graphic" title="Graphic" src="/+.gif" width="16" height="14">Abstract</a>
<div id="layer_3" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p class="align">Using a regression discontinuity design, this paper investigates the causal impacts of 9-year compulsory education on studentsâ€™ educational attainment and dropout rate by Taiwan Population and Housing Census. The results show that the policy reduces approximately 4 percentage points of the dropout likelihood by age 15 and 2 percentage points of the dropout likelihood by age 18, also increases schooling years by 0.22. Furthermore, heterogeneous effects are observed across gender and ethnicity.</p></div>
